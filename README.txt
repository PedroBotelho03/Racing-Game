Welcome to our Retro Space Jam!
With our amazing game, it is possible to have the experience of both Single Player and Multiplayer (2 local players) mode.

Single Player Mode:
-> In this mode, players engage in an amazing race on a challenging road, while earning score based on the distance they drive.
The player's achievements are prominently displayed on the scoreboard interface (on the main menu) if they manage to secure a position among their top ten scores.
Caution is advised when utilizing power-ups, as players may encounter detrimental ones such as speed boosts or inverted controls, as well as beneficial power-ups like invincibility or slowing effects.

Multiplayer Mode:
-> In this game mode, two players may play the game in two different roads, and their main objective is to avoid crashing, as the first player to collide with a car loses the game.
Both players will encounter power-ups, but here’s the special twist: if a player collides with a power-up that would negatively affect their car in the single player, in the multiplayer this effect will affect the adversary instead, making the game more exiting and competitive.

Power-Ups:
-> Beneficial Power-Ups: Slow down and invincibility.
-> Negative Power-Ups: Speed up and inverted controls.
In the Power-Up script, the super method is invoked and two additional methods, called reset_position and update.
The methods contribute to the functionality and behavior of the power-ups within the game.

Addition Features:
-> Game Mode – Allows the players to choose between Single and Multiplayer game modes.
